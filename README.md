# Your Health Data: Visualized!

## Overview
This project was initiated by UC Berkeley data science students as part of W209 Final project.
The goal of this application is to allow users to generate health summary statistics and view visualization based on their Apple Health data on demand. Types of visualization you can expect to see include:

 - Personalized Heart Rate vs Step Count 
 - Step Count Trend by Date
 - Basal energy vs Distance
 - Flights climbed by Date

### Upload Feature
By default the visualizations will use a sample dataset and the upload feature is disabled. For own personal use, you can download the repo and re-enable the upload feature by uncomment out the section of code in `app.py`
